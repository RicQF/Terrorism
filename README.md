# Predicting the Perpetrators of Terrorist Attacks: A Machine Learning Approach

Terrorism is a global threat that affects countries and communities around the world. It is a tactic used by terrorist groups to achieve their political, religious, or ideological goals through the use of violence and fear. The impact of terrorist attacks on victims, their families, and society as a whole is devastating and long-lasting.
Number of attacks has increased year by year and also the more active groups have changed over time.
In order to combat terrorism and protect people from its effects, it is important to understand the different types of attacks and the groups behind them.
The goal of this project is to classify terrorist attacks according to the groups responsible for them. By analyzing the characteristics of attacks and the groups that carry them out, we can gain insights into the motivations, tactics, and methods used by different terrorist organizations. This knowledge can help counter-terrorism efforts and prevent future attacks.
